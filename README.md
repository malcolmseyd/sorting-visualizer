# Sorting Visualizer 

This is a web-based sorting algorithm visualizer, written entirely in plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

You can see a live demo [here](https://malcolmseyd.ca/sorting/).

## Why?

Why vanilla Javascript? I was familiar with React, Typescript, and all that stuff, but had yet to make something useful without transpiling anything.  I figured that this could be a fun challenge that would make me more familiar with the browser's API.

Why sorting algorithms? Because I just finished [a course on them](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2021051/CSC225) and also I think it looks cool. Apparently [a lot of other people do as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg). I might add sound effects in the future just for fun.
